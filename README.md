# Scheduler Fix for Loop Hero

Fixes a problem described here:
- https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/fps-issue-getting-wierd-fps-drops-sometimes.14564/
Also this is more or less just a reimplementation of
- https://github.com/omicronrex/gms_scheduler_fix
but not posing as DBGHELP.dll, cause, why should it if dynamic loading is possible by YYTK itself.
